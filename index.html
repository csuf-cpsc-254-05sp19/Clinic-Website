                                    <p>I am a Computer Science student at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) and my interests include <b>software engineering</b>, <b>artificial intelligence</b>, and <b>machine learning</b>. I currently work as a Supplemental Instruction Leader for the Computer Science Department at CSUF and I'm doing research under CSUF Associate Professor <a href="http://ecs.fullerton.edu/~mgofman/">Dr. Gofman</a>. Over the summer, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at <a href="https://www.rockwellcollins.com/">Rockwell Collins</a> in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.</p>
                                    <p>A few hobbies of mine include playing the guitar, working on personal projects, and learning new things. Whenever I seen an opportunity to learn, I make sure to take it. Every time I begin a new project, I make sure it incorporates something I haven't done before.</p>
